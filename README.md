Professional   Portfolio   Management
(Semester 2, 2023/2024)
60% Assignment

In this   reflective assignment,   please give a summary of the   key lessons   you   have   learned from the team assignment (12%) and provide   detailed   discussion   and   evaluation on two of the following scenarios that you have found   most   applicable/ relevant to you   (48%).
●         Identify one aspect of the assignment that you found most   challenging.   How did you overcome that challenge?   Explain.
●       There   is a   conflict   of opinions   in   the   team   regarding   a   decision.      How   did   you as a member of the team   help   in   managing the   conflict?
●       There are   practical   challenges   in   applying   one   particular theory.      Discuss   the trade-off in your decision   making in   implementing the theory in   your            practice.
●       There   is   limited amount   of   resource and   skill   in   your   team.   What   steps   did   you take to make sure you were working as   an   effective team?
●       You   have   proposed an   important   initiative during   the   project.      Explain   what   it   is and evaluate its   contribution   critically.
●       One   decision that   you wish   you   and/or   your team   could   have   made
differently.    Describe the context of the decision.   Explain what   alternative         actions could have   been taken.    Reflect objectively   on what   has   prevented   such decision to   be   made.
●       On   hindsight,   how   may you   approach the task   differently?   Why   do   you   think this different approach will   be   better?
●       Any other ‘critical incidents’   that   you   find   valuable   to   your   learning.   Explain.
Successful Criteria
In general, a good   piece of reflective assignment   is   demonstrating that   on
reflecting on what you have done, you gain   new   insights   about either   the   subject      knowledge/practice or yourself.    It   is important to   present the   context   clearly   and         then analyse what   has happened (why a decision   is   made   or why   one   member of   the group would think differently from others etc.) using evidence   and   perhaps   theory about decision making and teamwork.    Based   on   the   analysis,   you   should   try to summarize what   new understanding you gain from this experience   (what   lesson have you   learned?   How to do things differently?)    These   lessons   need to   be   logical and are not wishful thinking.    One   bad example   of   lessons   lear代 写LUBS3655 Professional Portfolio ManagementMatlab

For each ‘critical incident’, consider the following questions:
●         How did you   behave   (individually / as a   group)?
●       What can you   learn from   this   about your   own /   group’s   performance?
●       What would you do   differently   in   the   same   situation   next   time?    What   lessons have you   learned?
See detailed criteria at the end.      If you are   in doubt,   please   contact the   module   leader for clarification.
Assignments   should   be   a   maximum   of   1500 words   in   length.All coursework assignments that contribute to the assessment of a   module   are   subject   to   a   word   limit,   as specified   in the online   module   handbook   in the relevant module   area   of the   MINERVA.   The word      limit   is an extremely   important aspect of good academic   practice, and   must   be   adhered   to.
Unless stated specifically otherwise   in the   relevant module handbook,   the   word   count   includes   EVERYTHING   (i.e. all text   in the   main body of the assignment   including summaries,   subtitles,   contents   pages, tables, supportive material whether in footnotes or   in-text   references)   except   the   main   title,   reference list and/or bibliography and any   appendices.      It   is   not   acceptable   to   present   matters   of   substance, which should   be   included   in the main body of the text,   in   the   appendices   (“appendix   abuse”).    It   is   not acceptable to attempt to   hide words   in   graphs   and   diagrams;   only text   which   is   strictly   necessary should be   included in graphs   and   diagrams.
You are required to adhere to the word   limit   specified   and   state   an   accurate word   count   on   the   cover      page of your assignment brief.    Your declared word count   must   be   accurate,   and   should   not   mislead.   Making a fraudulent statement concerning the work submitted for assessment could   be   considered academic malpractice and   investigated as such.      If the amount of work   submitted   is   higher than   that   specified by the word   limit or that declared on your word   count,   this   may   be   reflected   in   the   mark awarded and noted through   individual feedback given to   you.
